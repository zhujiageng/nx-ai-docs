# Integrated Repos vs. Package-Based Repos vs. Standalone Apps

There are two styles of monorepos that you can build with Nx: integrated repos and package-based repos. At the most basic level, package-based repos utilize Nx's core features while integrated repos also use the plugin features. But the difference is more about the mindset than the features used and the style choice is on a spectrum - not a boolean.

- Package-based repos focus on flexibility and ease of adoption.
- Integrated repos focus on efficiency and ease of maintenance.

## Package-Based Repos

A package-based repo is a collection of packages that depend on each other via `package.json` files and nested `node_modules`. With this setup, you typically have [different dependencies for each project](/more-concepts/dependency-management). Build tools like Jest and Webpack work as usual, since everything is resolved as if each package was in a separate repo and all of its dependencies were published to npm. Moving an existing package into a package-based repo is very easy since you generally leave that package's existing build tooling untouched. Creating a new package inside the repo is just as difficult as spinning up a new repo since you have to create all the build tooling from scratch.

Lerna, Yarn, Lage, [Turborepo](/more-concepts/turbo-and-nx) and Nx (without plugins) support this style.

## Integrated Repos

An integrated repo contains projects that depend on each other through standard import statements. There is typically a [single version of every dependency](/more-concepts/dependency-management) defined at the root. Sometimes build tools like Jest and Webpack need to be wrapped to work correctly. It's harder to add an existing package to this repo style because the build tooling for that package may need to be modified. It's straightforward to add a brand-new project to the repo because all the tooling decisions have already been made.

Bazel and Nx (with plugins) support this style.

## Standalone Applications

Nx plugins, especially the [generators](/plugin-features/use-code-generators), [executors](/plugin-features/use-task-executors) and [migrations](/core-features/automate-updating-dependencies) that come with them, are not only valuable for a monorepo scenario. In fact, many developers use Nx not primarily for its monorepo support, but for its tooling support, particularly its ability to modularize a codebase and, thus, better scale it. In v15.3, Nx introduced support for Standalone Applications. It is like an integrated monorepo setup, but with just a single, root-level application. Think of it as an advanced, more capable Create-React-App or Angular CLI. And obviously, you can still leverage all the generators and executors and structure your application into libraries or submodules.

## How to Choose

Nx itself doesn't care which style you choose. You can have a package-based repo setup and still host projects that use Nx plugins from the integrated repo setup. Hence you end up with a "hybrid" approach. Similarly, a Standalone App workspace setup is none other than an integrated Nx monorepo, but with only one application using a different folder layout.

You can be successful working in any style, and there are ways to transition between them. At a high level

- **standalone apps -** for when you want a single project that can be nicely structured and modularized. It's a good starting point if you're not looking into a monorepo but with the option to expand later.
- **package-based repos -** ideally when you already have a monorepo (e.g. yarn/npm/pnpm workspace) and you want Nx primarily for speed and task scheduling. Also, when you want Nx to stay mostly out of your way and you set up everything on your own.
- **integrated repos -** when you want more help from Nx. It takes away the burden of the configuration by coming up with a pre-configured setup that scales well, and provides scaffolding support and automated code migrations. Organizations choose this approach if they are bought into monorepos and want to scale up. Integrated repos might restrict some choices to allow Nx to help you more but result in better maintainability and more value in the long run.

The comparison between package-based repos and integrated repos is similar to that between JSDoc and TypeScript. The former is easier to adopt and provides some good benefits. The latter takes more work but offers more value, especially at a larger scale.
