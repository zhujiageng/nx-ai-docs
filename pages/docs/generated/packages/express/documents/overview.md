[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is mature, minimal, and an open source web framework for making web applications and
apis.

## Setting Up Express

To create a new workspace with Express, run the following command:

```shell
 npx create-nx-workspace --preset=express
```

### Adding Express to an Existing Project

Install the express plugin

{% tabs %}
{%tab label="npm"%}

```shell
npm i --save-dev @nx/express
```

{% /tab %}
{%tab label="yarn"%}

```shell
yarn add --dev @nx/express
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Creating Applications

Add a new application to your workspace with the following command:

```shell
nx g @nx/express:app my-app
```

Serve the application by running

```shell
nx serve my-app
```

This starts the application on localhost:3333/api by default.

> Express does not come with any library generators, but you can leverage the[`@nx/js`](/packages/js#create-libraries) plugin to generate a Node.js library for your express application.

### Application Proxies

The Express application generator has an option to configure other projects in the workspace to proxy API requests. This
can be done by passing the `--frontendProject` with the project name you wish to enable proxy support for.

```shell
nx g @nx/express:app <express-app> --frontendProject my-react-app
```

## Using Express

### Testing Projects

You can run unit tests with:

```shell
nx test <project-name>
```

### Building Projects

Express projects can be built with:

```shell
nx build <project-name>
```

Build artifacts will be found in the `dist` directory under `apps/<project-name>` by default. Customize the build
configuration by editing `outputPath` in the [project configuration](/reference/project-configuration).

### Waiting for Other Tasks

You can wait for other tasks to run before serving the express app which can be handy for spinning up various services
the application depends onâ€” for example, other apis in a microservice.

Setting the `waitUntilTargets` option with an array of targets (format: `"project:target"`) executes those tasks
before serving the Express application.
