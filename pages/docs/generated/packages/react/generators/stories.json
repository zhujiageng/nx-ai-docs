The stories will be generated using [Component Story Format 3 (CSF3)](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-csf3-is-here/).\n\n```bash\nnx g @nx/react:stories project-name\n```\n\nYou can read more about how this generator works, in the [Storybook for React overview page](/packages/storybook/documents/overview-react#auto-generate-stories).\n\nWhen running this generator, you will be prompted to provide the following:\n\n- The `name` of the project you want to generate the configuration for.\n- Whether you want to `generateCypressSpecs`. If you choose `yes`, a test file is going to be generated in the project's Cypress e2e app for each of your components.\n\nYou must provide a `name` for the generator to work.\n\nThere are a number of other options available. Let's take a look at some examples.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Ignore certain paths when generating stories\n\n```bash\nnx g @nx/react:stories --name=ui --ignorePaths=libs/ui/src/not-stories/**,**/**/src/**/*.other.*\n```\n\nThis will generate stories for all the components in the `ui` project, except for the ones in the `libs/ui/src/not-stories` directory, and also for components that their file name is of the pattern `*.other.*`.\n\nThis is useful if you have a project that contains components that are not meant to be used in isolation, but rather as part of a larger component.\n\n### Generate stories using JavaScript instead of TypeScript\n\n```bash\nnx g @nx/react:stories --name=ui --js=true\n```\n\nThis will generate stories for all the components in the `ui` project using JavaScript instead of TypeScript. So, you will have `.stories.js` files next to your components.\n",
