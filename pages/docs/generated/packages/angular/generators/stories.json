If you choose `yes`, a test file is going to be generated in the project's Cypress e2e app for each of your components.\n\nYou must provide a `name` for the generator to work.\n\nThere are a number of other options available. Let's take a look at some examples.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Ignore certain paths when generating stories\n\n```bash\nnx g @nx/angular:stories ui --ignorePaths=libs/ui/src/not-stories/**,**/**/src/**/*.other.*\n```\n\nThis will generate stories for all the components in the `ui` project, except for the ones in the `libs/ui/src/not-stories` directory, and also for components that their file name is of the pattern `*.other.*`.\n\nThis is useful if you have a project that contains components that are not meant to be used in isolation, but rather as part of a larger component.\n",
