# Nx Console Projects Pane

Clicking on the name of any project navigates to that project's `project.json` file. Clicking on the name of any executor command navigates to that executor command's definition in the `project.json` file.

Clicking the ![refresh-light.svg](/shared/images/nx-console/refresh-light.svg) icon next to the `PROJECTS` header repopulates the Projects pane from the `project.json` files.

Clicking the ![folder-light.svg](/shared/images/nx-console/folder-light.svg) icon next to a project reveals that project's folder in the VSCode Explorer pane.

Clicking the ![continue-light.svg](/shared/images/nx-console/continue-light.svg) icon next to an executor command executes that command without prompting for options.
