# Nx Console Add Dependency command

The `Add Dependency` & `Add Dev Dependency` commands allow you to specify a package and version to be installed using your local package manager. If it contains an `init` generator or `ng-add` schematic, you might be prompted to select some options before it's executed.

There are multiple ways to execute the command:

- via the command prompt (`ctrl/cmd + shift + p`)
- via the `Common Nx Commands` view
- via a CodeLens on the root `package.json` (see below)
